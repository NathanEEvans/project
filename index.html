                <h3>Welcome to Stormcloud IDE</h3>

                <p>
                    How many times did you have to (re)install your development environment?, just because you changed PC, Jobs or the lot. There you go, install a JDK, Maven, Git, an IDE, 
                    MySQL and all those other things like the fiddling with your environment to get going ... 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course all those fresh installs do not have your prefered configurations and you will have to go over the bunch of settings they carry. Again.
                    More extra todo's before you actually start writing some code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You might also be in the habit of working on different machines. But yes, working on the same projects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also you could have discussions with co-coders about, hey it works for him but does not work for me. Or what about online pair-programming?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Have the time for a few cups-a-jaba too many before the whole circus is up and running in the morning?
                </p>

                <h3>I get it, i get it, so what's the magic?</h3>

                <p>
                    The magic is found in a feature rich Java Development Environment served to you straight from the Browser. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine a fully functional development environment (yes including the supporting acts like databases, web services and what have you not) which will
                    when you open it in the browser on your laptop be in the exact same state as when you closed it on your company PC.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine deploying your build to Tomcat or any Application Server trough a right click in the Project explorer in your browser and run/test the applicartion directly 
                    in another tab or browser window? 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine you can debug the application, in the browser. Yes, a server-side app running on a VM being debugged in your browser.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That and all other useful IDE functionality you can find on your desktop IDE as well these days.
                </p>

                <h3>Sounds great, how does it work?</h3>

                <p>
                    The Stormcloud IDE is divided into three main projects, 'The Backbone', being GUI, API And RFS (They are lined up on the left side, clicking on them takes you their GitHub pages) and three supporting projects, Model, Installer and the Project Super Pom & Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there is the GUI project which obviously is the thing you deal with in your face. The aim of this GUI is
                    to look and offer what a normal desktop IDE looks like and offers to the Java Developer.
                </p>
                
                <img src="images/run%20maven%20command.tiff">

                <p> 
                    This GUI is pointed at a Rest API on a server which in turn knows all about your home directory trough the RFS where all your personal development parts are living. 
                    That would look very much like this when a C-something-O asked to have a mushot of the thing. 
                </p>
